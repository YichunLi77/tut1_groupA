# Wheels of Fortune â€“ p5.js Rendering

This is the A part of our group work: data generation and rendering structure for Pacita Abad's *Wheels of Fortune*.

## Files

- `index.html`: main HTML entry
- `sketch.js`: p5.js setup & draw loop
- `wheel.js`: Wheel class and pattern drawing
- `style.css`: basic styles

## My Contribution

I created the data and rendering system. Each Wheel has position, rotation, radius, color palette, and pattern style (`dots`, `concentric`, `lines`). This modular design allows easy extension for animation and interaction by other teammates.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Open `index.html` in browser
